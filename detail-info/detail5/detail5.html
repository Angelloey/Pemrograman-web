        In 1999, this won a Grammy for Best Rock Performance By A Duo Or Group
        With Vocal. It was the fourth time Aerosmith won that award; Grammy
        voters didn't warm to the band until the '90s, when they gave them the
        trophy for "Janie's Got A Gun."
        <br />Steven Tyler wrote this with help from Richie Supa and Glen
        Ballard; it's a rare Aerosmith song with no Joe Perry writing credit.<br />
        Supa is a friend of the band was also co-wrote the Aerosmith hit
        "Amazing"; Ballard also co-wrote the Nine Lives track "Falling in Love
        (Is Hard on the Knees)." In a Songfacts interview with Ballard, he
        explained that the band was sober during this time, so they got their
        "high" from coffee, drinking lots of espresso.
