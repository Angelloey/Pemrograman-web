      <h1>7 Rings</h1>
      <p>
        “7 rings,” which features Ariana boasting about money and many other
        luxuries, including diamonds and houses, is the second official single
        from Ariana Grande’s fifth studio album, thank u, next after Ariana
        announced that “imagine” will act as a promotional single for the album.
        The title is in reference to a collection of matching friendship rings
        Ariana and six of her friends bought in New York.
        <br />On December 1st, Ariana revealed the owners of the rings: herself,
        Victoria Monét, Courtney Chipolone, Alexa Luria, Tayla Parx, Njomza and
        Kaydence Krysiuk, all of whom have a writing credit on the song except
        Courtney and Alexa.<br />
        In December 2018, Ariana confirmed via Twitter that the “thank u, next”
        video featured a “7 rings” snippet, playing a loop of the instrumental
        at the beginning.
