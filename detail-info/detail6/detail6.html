      <h1>Sweet/ I Though You Wanted to Dance</h1>
      <p>
        First released as a teaser on June 14, 2021, “SWEET / I THOUGHT YOU
        WANTED TO DANCE” is a two-part song that continues the trend regarding
        every tenth track of the albums from Tyler, The Creator’s discography,
        which first began with his debut studio album, Bastard. The teaser
        features Travis Bennett, otherwise known as Taco, a member from the now
        split-up collective, Odd Future.<br />
        “SWEET” is the height of Tyler’s infatuation with this girl, while on “I
        THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DANCE” she begins to have more mixed feelings
        until she chooses her partner over him, giving Tyler mixed emotions.<br />
        During a special performance in Brooklyn for Amazon Music, Tyler
        revealed he first felt inspired to lay down the reggae-influenced
        composition for “I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DANCE” after watching Lovers
        Rock, a film from Steve McQueen’s 2020 British anthology series Small
        Axe – which focuses on the life of the West Indian community in London
        from the 1960s to the 1980s – that hosts several British reggae and R&B
        songs in its soundtrack.
