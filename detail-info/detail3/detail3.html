      <h1>See You Again</h1>
      <p>
        Tyler’s favorite off of Flower Boy, “See You Again” is a love song. The
        song features vocals from Kali Uchis, who appeared on Tyler’s 2015 album
        Cherry Bomb on “FIND YOUR WINGS” and “FUCKING YOUNG / PERFECT.”
        <br />The person Tyler sings to on this song seems to be his ideal
        lover, as they only live in his fantasy and dream state. Whenever he
        wakes up this person disappears, and therefore he doesn’t wish to wake
        up. While he is very much in love with them, he hates constantly waiting
        and chasing. <br />The song directly follows the interlude “Sometimes…”
        where we hear a male voice ask Shane Powers to play the song about him
        on Golf Radio. What comes next is “See You Again.” This implies that the
        song is likely about a man.
